=== Configuring Queues

The domibus-connector-plugin requires an additional queue. You have to configure it at your Message-Broker. If you are running the gateway with the embedded Message-Broker you have to add the queue definition into the activemq.xml file. The file is located at $DOMIBUS-CONFIG-LOCATION/internal/activemq.xml

Add the following lines next to the other queue definitions (this will create the queue):

[source, xml]
----
<queue id="dcpluginNotificationsQueue" physicalName="${dcplugin.notifications.queue}" />
----
