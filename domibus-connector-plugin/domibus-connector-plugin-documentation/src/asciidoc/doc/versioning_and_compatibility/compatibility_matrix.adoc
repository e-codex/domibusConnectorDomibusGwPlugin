NOTE: Gateway Plugin-API does not directly refer to the gateway version. Instead it declares by the gateway supported plugin API. So as long as a future gateway version supports the used plugin-API version it should work. (Gateway 4.2.0 has deprecated the 4.1 gateway plugin API, but a plugin built against 4.1 plugin API would still run on a gateway 4.2.2.)
