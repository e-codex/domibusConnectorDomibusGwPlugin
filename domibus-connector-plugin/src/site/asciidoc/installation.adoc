== Preconditions

* Domibus Gateway setup is complete and domibus is running
* Domibus UI is reachable under $UI-URL
* Domibus is reachable under $DOMIBUS-URL
* Domibus-config folder is located under $DOMIBUS-CONFIG-LOCATION

TIP: Consult the link:https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/download/attachments/352387309/%28eDelivery%29%28AP%29%28AG%29%284.2.1%29%288.6%29.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1619426922903&api=v2[domibus administration guide] for details

== First Steps

Download the most recent domibusConnectorDomibusPlugin via
link:https://secure.e-codex.eu/nexus/content/groups/public/eu/domibus/connector/plugin/domibus-connector-plugin-Distribution/[]

Extract the downloaded distribution package to any location, this location will
from now on be referenced as $PLUGIN-DISTRIBUTION

Also make sure that you use the installation manual of this specific version.
This installation manual is for version: **{project-version}**.


== Installing the plugin on domibus

The plugin comes packaged as a jar file. This jar file has to be
put into the domibus plugin lib folder, so domibus wil find it
during startup:

[source, bash]
----
cp $PLUGIN-DISTRIBUTION/plugins/lib/domibus-connector-plugin.jar $DOMIBUS-CONFIG-LOCATION/conf/plugins/lib/domibus-connector-plugin.jar
----

=== Configuring Queues

The domibus-connector-plugin requires an additional queue. You have to configure it at your Message-Broker. If you are running the gateway with the embedded Message-Broker you have to add the queue definition into the activemq.xml file. The file is located at $DOMIBUS-CONFIG-LOCATION/internal/activemq.xml

Add the following lines next to the other queue definitions:

[source, xml]
----
<queue id="dcpluginNotificationsQueue" physicalName="domibus.dcplugin.notifications" />
----

=== Configuring certificates

TODO: describe locations of certificate stores...link to java key store explorer + key generation tutorial.


=== Configuring the plugin

Add the following properties to your domibus.properties file:

[source, properties]
----
include::../../../domibus-connector-plugin-domibus_4_x/src/main/resources/config/dc-plugin-default.properties[lines=1..-1]
----

TIP: As an alternative the properties can also be put into a file under ${domibus.config.location}/plugins/config/dcplugin.properties. For details see the link:https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/download/attachments/352387309/%28eDelivery%29%28AP%29%28Plugin-CB%29%28Domibus.4.2.1%29%284.1%29.pdf?version=2&modificationDate=1616499371407&api=v2[plugin cookbook] (chapter 4.1 Property files) of the domibus gateway.

WARNING: Please remember to update the properties according to your environment.

== Checks

Restart the domibus GW. Open the domibus UI and login with the admin user. On the left side open the 'Message Filter' there should now be
a **DC_PULL_PLUGIN** or **DC_PUSH_PLUGIN** available (depends on the configured connector.delivery.mode).

TIP: Consult the link:https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/download/attachments/352387309/%28eDelivery%29%28AP%29%28AG%29%284.2.1%29%288.6%29.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1619426922903&api=v2[domibus administration guide] (chapter 10.4 Message Filtering) to learn more about message filtering.
